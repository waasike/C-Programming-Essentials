# C Programming Essentials.
A personal collection of essential learning areas in C Programming <br> currently learning in school using personal examples.
## Data Types 
1. Declaring and Initializing an Integer Data Type variable.
2. Declaring and Initializing a Float Data Type variable.
3. Declaring and Initializing a Double Data Type variable.
4. Declaring and Initializing a Character Data Type variable.
5. Declaring and Initializing a String Data Type variable. (Using Array Format)
6. Printing out the variables.
7. Specific Format Specifiers for each Data Type.
## Output
1. Printing out "Hello World".
## User Input
1. Storing the user input in a variable using the "scanf" keyword together with the %format specifiers of each Data Type.
2. Printing out the the user input variable.
## Operators
1. Declaring and Initializing variables.
2. Printing out the Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical and Assignment Operators.
## Control Structures
1. Declaring and Initializing a variable or collecting user input and storing in variables.
2. Printing out a statment based on the if, else-if and nested if-else statment.
## Switch Case
1. Declaring and Initializing a character variable.
2. Defining print statments based on the different cases and break the cases.
3. Inserting a default case.
## Loops
1. Declaring and Initializing the loop variables.
2. Stating the loop condition.
3. Updating the counter variable.
4. Format using different loopstructures i.e For Loop, While Loop and Do While Loop.
## Statments
1. Using the Break Statment to terminate a loop.
2. Using the Continue Statment to skip a value in a loop.
3. Using the Goto Statment to direct a condition to the print statment.
## Arrays
1. Declaring and Initializing an array of values.
2. Printing out a value from its index position.
3. Application in Single dimensional Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays.
## Pointers
1. Declaring and Initializing a variable.
2. Declaring the pointer.
3. Printing out the pointer values.
